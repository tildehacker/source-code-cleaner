# source-code-cleaner
An attempt to make all my source code files consistent.

## Motivation
Sometimes I just need to check if all files in a project are consistent (same indentation style, same indent size, have UNIX line ending,...).
I made this script for that.

## How to use
Read the script, edit it for your own needs and then run it.
